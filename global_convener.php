                                	<b>IYALODE ALABA OLUWASEUN LAWSON </b>was born on the 18th January 1951 to Papa and Mrs. Emmanuel Abiona Jiboku in Abeokuta. Her father was the late Pa Jiboku <i><b>(aka Jiboku Tannatanna)</b></i> of the defunct Electricity Corporation of Nigeria (ECN) and her mother was the daughter of Aderupoko Coker fame of Itesi, Abeokuta.

                                ALABA had her Primary Education at St. James’s African Primary School, Idi-Ape, Abeokuta, between 1957-1962. From here, she proceeded to Abeokuta Girls’ Grammar School, also known as Anglican Girls’ Grammar School where she obtained the West African School Certificate 1963-1967.

                                She started her teaching career in 1969 and later left for St. Nicholas Montessori Teachers’ Training College at Prince’s Gate England in 1973 for further studies where she obtained a 1st Class Diploma in Education with distinction. The first African student to be so rated at the institution. A testimonial issued and signed by the co-principals in 1975 attests to this. It reads and I quote:
